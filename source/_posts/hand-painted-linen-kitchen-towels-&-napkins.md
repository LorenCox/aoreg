In my kitchen, each season I change out accents to make the otherwise neutral room feel similar to that particular season.  Little touches like adding clean colored kitchen towels and a stack of linen napkins could make a big difference in making the entire bedroom feel just like Spring, for case in point.  To be able to match my seasonally evolving home, I have made a range of custom home linens that boast the best color combinations and hand-stitched monograms.   On top of that, this job can be done by the most un-gifted artist.

Directions : 

Begin by reducing the linen into the size of that you’d like to try to make.  For a napkin, a 20-inch square is a standard size, and 24 by 30-inches works ideal for kitchen towels.  Allow 1-in. extra around the perimeter for the seam.  Place a bit of craft paper on your own surface before beginning.  Place the linen down and work with painter’s tape to create stripes.  For a ‘plaid’ effect you’ll do the perpendicular stripes in split phases.

To help make the paint, mixture the color you’d prefer to use after that dilute it with 2 parts water.  Dip your paint brush in the color, then dab off until the vast majority of the liquid can be off of the brush, leaving only a small amount coating the bristles.  That is called a dry brush method.  Lightly begin to brush the liquid on with actual strokes.  Continue until each of the stripes certainly are a homogeneous color and strength.

Remove the tape and replicate to complete your decision on the pattern.

Allow paint dry for a number of hours.  

Hem the edges of the linens with a 1/2 seam.  Rinse in cold water and press.

I set an "H" monogram on our napkins with embroidery floss by using a simple running stitch.
